    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "To prepare the data for modeling, we perform several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Loading & Cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    " Read the CSV dataset (detailed_meals_macros_.csv) into a pandas DataFrame. Use the DataCleaner class (from the Data_Preprocessing module) to drop duplicate entries, remove rows with missing values, and normalize column names (strip whitespace, replace spaces with underscores, and convert to lowercase for consistency).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature Engineering: \n",
    "\n",
    " Leverage the DataPreprocessor class (from Data_Preprocessing) to create additional features.We convert height from centimeters to meters and calculate the BMI for each individual. An obesity label is then derived based on gender-specific BMI thresholds (e.g., BMI ≥ 30 for males, BMI ≥ 25 for females are labeled obese). This label is stored in a new column (e.g., obesity with values 1 for obese and 0 for non-obese).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encoding Categorical Variables: \n",
    "\n",
    " Categorical features such as activity level and dietary preference are label-encoded to numeric values using scikit-learn’s LabelEncoder. Gender is already handled in the obesity feature creation (mapped to 0/1), so it is treated as numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature Selection: \n",
    "\n",
    " We drop irrelevant or non-numeric columns that won’t be used in modeling. In particular, textual columns like meal suggestions (breakfast_suggestion, lunch_suggestion, dinner_suggestion, snack_suggestion) and the disease column are removed. These columns contain free-text or goal descriptions that are not directly usable by the model. We also drop the original height and weight features since BMI (which we keep as a feature) already captures the relationship between height and weight for obesity classification. This helps reduce redundancy and multicollinearity in our feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    " All remaining feature columns (which are now numeric) are normalized using StandardScaler to ensure they are on a similar scale. This step improves the logistic regression model’s convergence and performance. The scaled feature matrix and the target vector are prepared for modeling."
